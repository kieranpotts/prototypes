= Prototypes

This repository contains various code prototypes, mostly for frontend web UI components.

Each prototype is a self-contained file. HTML files can be loaded directly in a browser from your local filesystem. In most cases, no server is required to test the web prototypes.

Refer to the source code for comments on the techniques trialed in each prototype, and links to sources.
